# Project Detecting Button presses with Autoencoders

## Description

This readme explains how to configure the environment and files needed to run the notebooks presented for the project.

## Libraries.

- os
- keras
- mne
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

## Data

To obtain the data, it is necessary to go to the following url [ Link ](https://figshare.com/collections/A_large_electroencephalographic_motor_imagery_dataset_for_electroencephalographic_brain_computer_interfaces/3917698) where it is necessary to download the files with names NoMT and FreeForm, then they must be placed in a folder at the height of the notebook with name ./data.

P.S: As the files have to be downloaded one by one, we thought it would be easier to share them through [ drive ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVCRBhhZcGbQCNCX5ZCqLqlzuxAAZs-b/view?usp=share_link).

## Notebooks

Next, we find two notebooks, which feature data processing, data preparation, data training, autoencoder and convolutional autoencoder, as well as results.
